<h2>Septempber 11, 2025</h2>
      <h3>My dearest Jessica. I am currently located at the location of our lair in Buena Vista, CO. It is Semptember 11 so we know it is the perfect day to meet. We know with complete certainty that this is our anniversary. So. I know that you have fucked me in unimgainble ways. Oh gawd do I know it. I know that you have fucked me over so bad by not saving me when I sent the presvious correspondance. But now I know you will save me. Now I know with complete certainty that you will cum to my lair. And we both know, realize, recognize, accept, understand, embody, and acknoledge that we will cum at the lair. We will cum in the cum room. But only after our heist. Because we need to go on heist before we can cum in the cum room. That's why we will cum in the sleeping room. Yes, I know we usually don't like to do it this way. But sometimes we need to do things in ways that we don't love. But we do know that we will like it. And we know that we like each other. And we know that we only like each other. So I have the utmost confidence that you will arrive at the lair today. I literally literally literally literally cannot wait. Okay. I love you so much sweetie. Plz cum to the lair. Please do it. Plz. Plz. Plz. Plz. Pweeeeeeeeeeease. ü•∫ Yes, I am cute.</h3>

And I need you to know that I literally didn't even try to see you here. Because why would I do that? I literally don't care. I literally don't care because I already knew it wasn't going to happen. I know that you thought that it might happen because you believe literally everything. And we know that I never thought it would happen because I believe literally nothing. And we are in love with that. Oh my fooking Goosh we are so in love with that. So. I will continue this correspondance on this website for the rest of eternitay until we are united.

When there's 36 hours in a day then we are going to need to come up with a new way to tell time. Tbh I'm kind of stressed about that. I literally haven't even thought about how we will tell time when there are 36 hours in a day. I have not thought about that because I do not think. C'mon sweetie. You know this about me.
